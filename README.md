# secret
A basic secret keeping web app with user authentication and encryption.
As I learn more about encryption and security, I add more branches containing higher and more secuer versions of the application.

## secret-v1
This version uses dotenv to set secret variable. 

### Usage
To use this version, you need to create a .env file and define a secret string.

     touch .env
     vim .env
     
     SECRET=THISISthesecret
